Plate Model

The main file for the plate model developed in Section 7.5 is

  plate_model_demo.m

which approximates the displacements of a thin plate with
clamped edges at x = 0, 0 < y < a and y = 0, 0 < x < ell
and free end conditions at the remaining edges.  A tensored
cubic spline basis is employed in the Galerkin discretization
detailed in Section 8.4.  The applied force is uniform in
space and harmonic in time with frequencies of 10 Hz, 12 Hz,
19 Hz, 26 Hz and 37 Hz.  The solution at the opint (ell,a) is
plotted as a function of time.
