Rod Model

The primary file for the rod code is

  rod_model_demo.m

This provides the option of characterizing the rod using a lumped
model (spring model) or the PDE model developed in Section 7.3
using the finite element techniques in Section 8.2.  The input
is taken to be a prespecified magnetic field which, for example,
could be computed using the models detailed in Chapter 4.  The
displacement is plotted as function of the input time or field. 

Note that this code can be directly used to characterize the
rod employed in a Terfenol-D transducer or can be modified to
model the stactked PZT actuators employed in an AFM. 

Required Functions:
  rod_model_construct.m
  ferroic_hyst.m
  ferroic_core.m
