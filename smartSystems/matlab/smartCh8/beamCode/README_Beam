Beam Model

The main file for the beam model developed in
Section 7.4 is

  beam_model_demo.m

which approximates the displacements of a cantilever
beam with fixed end conditions at x=0 and free end
conditions at x = L.  A cubic spline basis is used
to discretize in space and the resulting semidiscrete
system is integrated in time using the stiff solver
ode15s.m.  The forcing function consists of a 5 Hz
signal, that is uniform in space, applied for T=.74
seconds.  After that, the beam vibrations are allowed
to decay.  The model includes the input term B used
in subsequent control design.  The solution is plotted
as a function of time at the spatial point x = 3*ell/5.
