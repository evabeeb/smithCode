AFM Model

The primary file for the AFM model is

  afm_model_demo

This employs a spring model calibrated to produce a response
that is equivalent to the rod model developed in Section 7.3
with the nonlinear constitutive relation (7.3).  It yields 
plots analogous to those in Section 7.3.3.  The code which
incorporates thermal relaxation is slow compared with that
which neglects relaxation.  Additional code for the polarization
model can be found in Chapter 2.
