(1) Homogenized Energy Magnetization Model

The main file for the homogenized energy magnetization model 
detailed in Section 4.7 is

  magnetization_model_demo.m

which provides the capability for running the model
with or without thermal activation using a normal/normal
density choices.  The model with thermal activation is
much slower than that without thermal activation.  Additional
facets of the model are illustrated by the polarization code
in CHAPTER2.
